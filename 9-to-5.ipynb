I am curious what percentage of the workforce for those jobs are held by women. Furthermore, what percentage of women hold positions in the highest paying industries such as software publishing, portfolio management and computer sciences?  Do women tend to make less money than men because they hold jobs that statistically pay less per hour? How much do women get in the highest paid industries compared to the average?
